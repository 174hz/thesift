The Aula F75 Pro has disrupted the mechanical keyboard market by offering "enthusiast-level" features at a mass-market price point. This 75% compact keyboard features a gasket-mount structure, which provides a flexible, cushioned typing feel that was previously only found in custom boards costing hundreds of dollars. The result is a "creamy" sound profile that makes every keystroke a satisfying tactile event.

Equipped with LEOBOG Reaper switches, the F75 Pro comes pre-lubricated and ready for high-speed typing. The PBT keycaps feature side-printed legends, leaving the top surface clean and preventing finger oils from wearing down the characters. The integrated volume knob provides a physical way to manage audio, while the 4,000 mAh battery ensures nearly a week of wireless use even with the vibrant RGB lighting active.

While it is marketed as a gaming keyboard, its utility for productivity is immense. The compact layout saves desk space, allowing for more ergonomic mouse movements, and the hot-swappable PCB allows users to change switches without soldering. Despite its budget-friendly price, the build quality feels dense and robust. The Aula F75 Pro is proof that high-end desk tools are now more accessible than ever.
