Desktop lighting is an often-overlooked component of a professional workstation. The BenQ ScreenBar Halo addresses this by providing an asymmetrical optical design that illuminates the desk space without creating any screen glare. Our 'Sift' highlights the integrated wireless controller, which allows for seamless adjustment of color temperature and brightness without adding clutter to your desk. 

It is an essential tool for reducing eye strain during late-night deep work sessions. The back-light feature also adds a layer of ambient bias lighting that reduces the contrast between the bright monitor and a dark room, further protecting the user's vision. By focusing light exactly where it is needed—on your physical documents and keyboard—the Halo creates a focused "zone" that signals your brain it is time for high-level concentration.
