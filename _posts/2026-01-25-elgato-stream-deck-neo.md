The Elgato Stream Deck Neo is a strategic reimagining of the classic macro pad, designed to transition from the "gamer" desk to the professional workstation. Featuring eight customizable LCD keys, the Neo simplifies complex workflows—like muting a mic, launching a set of productivity apps, or pasting pre-written text—into a single tap. What sets the Neo apart is its "Infobar," a horizontal display that provides real-time information like the time, CPU usage, or active notifications.

Navigation has been streamlined with two "Touch Points" located on either side of the Infobar, allowing users to swipe through different pages of shortcuts with a tap. This "page turning" mechanic makes the device feel more like a modern smart-home hub than a peripheral. The design is sleek and minimalist, finished in a clean white that matches modern "Aesthetic" desk setups.

The true power of the Neo lies in the Elgato Marketplace, which offers thousands of plugins for professional software like Microsoft Teams, Excel, and Adobe Creative Cloud. It effectively lowers the barrier to automation, making "pro-level" efficiency accessible to anyone. Compact, stylish, and incredibly powerful, the Stream Deck Neo is the command center for the modern digital desktop.
