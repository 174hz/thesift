The BenQ ScreenBar Pro is a sophisticated lighting solution designed to reclaim desk real estate while significantly reducing ocular fatigue. Unlike traditional lamps that create screen glare, the Pro uses an asymmetrical optical design that illuminates only the workspace, leaving the monitor perfectly dark. This engineering feat is paired with a high Color Rendering Index (CRI) of Ra 96, which mimics natural daylight to improve focus and color accuracy for creators.

One of the standout features of the Pro model is its integrated ultrasonic motion sensor. This technology accurately detects human presence, automatically illuminating the desk when you sit down and powering off after five minutes of inactivity. It’s an "invisible" convenience that quickly becomes indispensable. The touch-sensitive controls on the bar allow for 16 levels of brightness and eight color temperature adjustments, ranging from focus-heavy cool whites to relaxing warm tones.

The clamp mechanism is universally compatible, fitting both flat and curved monitors without obstructing built-in webcams. By bathing the desk in a flicker-free, diffuse glow, the ScreenBar Pro creates a focused environment that eliminates the harsh shadows that lead to headaches. It isn't just a lamp; it is an atmospheric upgrade for any high-performance workstation.
