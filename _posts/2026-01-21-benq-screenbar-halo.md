Desktop lighting is an often-overlooked component of a professional workstation. The BenQ ScreenBar Halo addresses this by providing an asymmetrical optical design that illuminates the desk space without creating any screen glare. Our 'Sift' highlights the integrated wireless controller, which allows for seamless adjustment of color temperature and brightness. It is an essential tool for reducing eye strain during late-night deep work sessions. The back-light feature also adds a layer of ambient bias lighting that reduces the contrast between the bright monitor and a dark room, further protecting the user's vision.
