Logitech's entry into the creative hardware space targets the tactile needs of digital artists and editors.

In our testing, the integration with the Adobe Creative Cloud suite stands out, allowing for minute adjustments like brush size or timeline scrubbing that a standard mouse simply cannot replicate. It’s an investment in speed and precision for those whose livelihood depends on the speed of their creative workflow, offering a "Sifted" experience that removes friction from the digital canvas.
