The Lepro TB1 is trending for its integration of AI into basic task lighting. It uses an onboard sensor to analyze your environment and automatically adjusts the color temperature to match your circadian rhythm.

It's a high-utility addition to any 2026 desk setup that prioritizes eye health and focus.
