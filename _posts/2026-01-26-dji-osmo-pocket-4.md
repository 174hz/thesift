The DJI Osmo Pocket 4 is being rebranded by productivity gurus in 2026 as the ultimate "Visual Note-Taker." While traditionally a vlogging camera, its new "Scan-Mode" has made it a viral hit for researchers and office workers. The Pocket 4 can automatically track and scan physical documents, whiteboards, or even 3D objects, instantly converting them into high-res digital files that sync to your cloud.

Its 1-inch sensor and 4K/120fps capabilities are impressive, but the real productivity win is the "AI Face-Tracking" for video calls. By plugging the Pocket 4 into a laptop via USB-C, it becomes a 3-axis stabilized webcam that follows you as you move around your office—perfect for "standing desk" workers who don't want to be tethered to a static camera.

The device is small enough to fit in a pocket, hence the name, but powerful enough to replace a full-sized scanner and high-end webcam. For the mobile professional who needs to capture data, attend meetings on the go, or document physical workflows, the Osmo Pocket 4 is a versatile Swiss Army knife that replaces multiple bulky gadgets.
