The DJI Osmo Pocket 4 is currently the center of a massive debate in the mobile videography community. This dedicated breakdown explores whether the rumored 1-inch sensor and the introduction of physical zoom buttons are enough to warrant an upgrade from the already excellent Pocket 3. 

The Sift analysis points toward a refined "Pro" focus. Social media influencers are particularly excited about the rumored ActiveTrack 7.0, which utilizes AI to maintain a lock on subjects even in crowded or low-light environments. For productivity-minded creators, the ability to use this as a high-end, face-tracking webcam for remote meetings is a primary selling point. While the hardware remains compact, the internal processing power has doubled, allowing for 4K/240fps slow-motion that was previously reserved for full-sized cinema cameras. It is a specialized tool designed to bridge the gap between "pocketable convenience" and "professional output."
