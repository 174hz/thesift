The Logitech MX Master 4 arrives as the refined successor to the world’s most popular productivity mouse, maintaining its crown through subtle but significant evolution. At its core, the silhouette remains familiar, honoring the ergonomic "Porsche 911" design that users have relied on for years. However, the introduction of customizable haptic feedback transforms the interaction. By providing tactile clicks through the thumb rest and main buttons, the mouse offers a physical layer of confirmation for complex shortcuts.

Material science has also taken a leap forward. The Master 4 utilizes a new stain-resistant silicone and recycled plastics that feel more premium while addressing the "greasy sheen" issues of older generations. The 8,000 DPI sensor continues to track flawlessly on glass, while the MagSpeed electromagnetic scroll wheel remains the gold standard for navigating long spreadsheets or lines of code.

Connectivity is handled via the Logi Bolt receiver and Bluetooth, supporting seamless switching between three devices. With the new "Actions Ring" software overlay, users can trigger app-specific commands—like brush size in Photoshop or muting in Zoom—without moving their hand. It is a masterpiece of efficiency, proving that even a perfect tool can be sharpened further for the modern professional.
