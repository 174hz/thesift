The HyperSpace Trackpad Pro is being hailed as the "Magic Trackpad for Windows" that actually works. In this dedicated review, the focus is on the device's force-sensing haptics. Unlike cheap Windows trackpads, the HyperSpace uses vibration motors to simulate a physical click anywhere on its surface, eliminating the "dead zones" at the top of the pad.

For "THE SIFT," the most important feature is the "Dynamic Action Zones." The trackpad software allows users to map specific gestures—like a two-finger swipe on the right edge—to productivity shortcuts like volume control or app switching. It features a 250Hz sampling rate, which provides a level of responsiveness that feels "liquid" during use. With a 4-week battery life and a premium CNC metal chassis, it is built for professionals who want to reclaim desk space by replacing their mouse with a more gestural, ergonomic interface.
